# Supervised Machine Learning - Predicting Credit Risk

Building a Machine Learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. 

## Background

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to 

To classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, to compare the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.


Creating and comparing two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before you create, fit, and score the models, make a prediction as to which model you think will perform better. 

## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model
